## Overview

![](resources/screenshot.png)

QR Code Component is a starting challenge from Frontend Mentor, where the purpose is to
create a card with a QR code and text and then center that card on the page, which
automatically adapts to the size of the browser window.

## My process

This project was made with the [replit.com](https://replit.com) IDE, where I used basic HTML and CSS. 
Also, I used some basic Flexbox properties to properly center the QR card.

Working on this project I was able to better develop my CSS skills, where I learned
key concepts of Flexbox, responsiveness and how to import external fonts into the code.

With this project done, I want to continue developing my front-end skills, learn more
about Flexbox, and do bigger and more complex projects.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me
to use Flexbox in my project, to centralize the QR card in a practical and easy way.
